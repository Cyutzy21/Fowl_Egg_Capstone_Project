Hello, I have started this website as a prototype for a future fowl and poultry website for a family member. I have used HTML and css as the main two technologies for this site. In the future i would like to add some javascript, as well as making the whole sight smoother. I would also like to add different pages, instead of having everything on the front page. I was unable to use the fake api, so i just started hard coding everything. Thanks for checking it out!
